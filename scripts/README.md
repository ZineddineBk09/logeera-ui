This directory contains scripts to populate your Logeera database with sample data for testing and development.

## ðŸŒ± API-Based Seeding Script

### `seed-database.js`

A comprehensive script that creates realistic test data through API endpoints (not direct database access).

**What it creates:**

- 1 Admin user
- 10 Regular users (with African names)

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Run the seeding script:**

   ```bash
   npm run db:seed-api
   # or
   pnpm db:seed-api
   ```

3. **Set admin role manually:**

   ```bash
   # Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:
   psql -d logeera -f scripts/set-admin-role.sql
   ```

   Or manually:

   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = 'admin@logeera.com';
   ```

   - Check that all migrations have been applied

2. **Registration Failures:**
   - Ensure database is properly set up
   - Check that all required environment variables are set

3. **Trip Creation Failures:**
   - Verify Google Maps API key is configured
   - Check that the trips API is working

```bash
npm run db:reset
npm run db:seed-api
```
